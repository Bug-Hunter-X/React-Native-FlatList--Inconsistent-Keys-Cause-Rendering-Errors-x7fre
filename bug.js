This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent key prop to its items.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items.  If keys are not unique or change unexpectedly, FlatList might behave erratically, leading to performance issues, incorrect rendering, or crashes. For instance:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id:1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id:2, name: 'Item 2'}, {id:1, name: 'Item 3'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} 
/>
```

In this example, the `keyExtractor` uses `item.id`, but the `id` value (1) is duplicated. This violates the uniqueness requirement and can lead to unexpected behavior.
